## My Blog

![banner](https://github.com/BalaElangovan/BalaElangovan.github.io/blob/master/Blog%20logo.png)

Hello Readers! My main areas of focus in this blog will be machine learning, exploratory analysis, various algorithms, and any other topics that catch my interest. I write as a pastime, and my articles often draw inspiration from numerous blogs, YouTube videos, and books(coz Iâ€™m still learning :D). I will cite them all at the end of each article.

I guarantee that all of my blogs will be succinct and to the point. Cheers!
