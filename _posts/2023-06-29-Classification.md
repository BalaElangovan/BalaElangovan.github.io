Classification is the process of recognizing, understanding and grouping objects or data into preset categories. Classification is a type of **Supervised Learning** as machine learning programs learns from pre-categorized datasets and use various algorithms to classify unknown datasets into categories.
Classification algorithms take a pre-categorized dataset as training datasets and train the model to categorize the likelihood of subsequent data into their respective categories.

> Tl;DR - Classification is a form of "Pattern recognition", with classification algorithms applied to training datasets to find same pattern in future sets of data.

## Types Of Classification Tasks in Machine Learning

1. **Binary Classification**

As the name suggests, Binary classification is a simple type of classification. The goal is to classify the input data into two mutually exclusive categories. The training datasets will be labelled in such a format.

> Examples - 0 and 1; true or false; positive and negative.

2. **Multi-Class Classification**

The multi-class classification has at least two mutually exclusive class labels and the goal is to predict which class a given input belongs to. Most of the binary classification algorithms can be used for this classification.

> Example - Classifying vegetables like carrot, potato and tomatos.


3. **Multi-Label Classification**

In multi-label classification, there is no mutual exclusion as the datasets can have more than one label for the input example. We can use binary classification or multi-class classification algorithm to perform multi-label classification. However, multi-label classification has their specialized algorithms like **Multi-label Decision Trees, Multi-label Gradient Boosting, Multi-label Random Forest** etc.

> Example - Categorising our shopping into categories. The different categories are like Shopping, Groceries, Transport, Eating out, Subscriptions, Rent etc.

4. **Imbalanced Classification**

As the name suggests, the data is unevenly distributed in each class, meaning one class will have more data than others in the training datasets. In this situation, We can't use conventional predictive models like decision trees, logistic regression as they might be biased towards the class with high number of observations.

the most commonly used approcahes are Sampling techniques and Cost sensitive techniques. These techniques aims to balance the distributions.

> Example - Consider the situation where the training data has 80% carrots, 15% potatos and 5% tomatos. The conventional models might be biased towards carrots.

## Some Popular Classification Algorithms in Machine Learning

1. Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is kind of like a linear regression, it is widely used when the classification problem is binary. Itâ€™s called regression but performs classification based on the regression and it classifies the dependent variable into either of the classes.

Independant variables are analyzed to determine the binary outcome with the results falling into two categories. The independant variables can be categoric or numeric, but the dependant variable is always categorica.

2. Naive Bayes Classification

3. K-Nearest Neighbours


K-NN works well with a small number of input variables (_p_), but struggles when the number of inputs is very large.

4. Decision Tree

5. Support Vector Machines
