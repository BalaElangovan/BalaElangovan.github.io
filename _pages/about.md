## Hello Readers! 
# I'm Bala. 

I'm a post-graduate student studying Data Science and Analytics. My main areas of focus in this blog will be machine learning, exploratory analysis, various algorithms, and any other topics that catch my interest. I write as a pastime, and my articles often draw inspiration from numerous blogs, YouTube videos, and books(coz I'm still learning :D). I will cite them all at the end of each article. 

I guarantee that all of my blogs will be succinct and to the point. Cheers!
